# TODO: Implement Modern Product Page in product.liquid

## Steps to Complete
- [x] Update product.liquid HTML structure to use CSS grid: left column for images (main image + slider), right column for product info and form.
- [x] Implement main image display using the first product image.
- [x] Add horizontal image slider below main image if more than one image exists, with prev/next buttons.
- [x] Add responsive CSS for modern styling: grid layout, mobile stacking, clean design.
- [x] Include basic JavaScript for slider navigation (prev/next functionality).
- [x] Ensure right side includes product title, price, description, variant select, quantity input, add-to-cart button, and payment options.
- [ ] Test responsiveness and functionality (followup step after implementation).

## Dependent Files
- sections/product.liquid (primary file to edit).

## Followup Steps
- After editing, test the product page in a Shopify store to ensure responsiveness and slider functionality.
- If needed, adjust CSS or JS based on theme styles or additional requirements.
